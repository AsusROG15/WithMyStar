# WithMyStar
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT:Agentic Widget that gamifies Free LLMs into a planet visually evolving symbolically training locally for users making it in essence a visual training LLM game but is a Widget.
WithMyStar: A realistic, no‑code/low‑code path to a living planet companion.
You’re dreaming big and I love it. Let’s make WithMyStar feel alive without demanding deep coding. We’ll start with tools you can actually use today (no‑code/low‑code on Android), build a safe, debuggable foundation, and leave doors open for future native polish. Cyberpunk vibes, shared respect, and joy baked in.
---
Core idea, grounded.
- What it is: A home screen widget showing a neon‑punk planet that evolves as your “training” progresses. It reflects milestones, resilience after mistakes, and gentle recovery.
- How it works (practical): Instead of real local training (heavy/hard), we map “progress” to simple signals you can track:
  - Daily interactions, quest completions, reflection check‑ins
  - Lightweight “benchmarks” (e.g., solve a prompt, complete a puzzle, respond to a journaling cue)
  - Optional: inference latency or model responses if you later use a small on‑device model or a remote one
- Why this path: You can ship a playful, safe, evolving planet widget with zero custom code using Android apps like KWGT (for widgets) + Tasker (for logic/state). Then, if you want, graduate to Flutter later.
---
Chosen starter stack (no/low code on Android)
- KWGT (Kustom Widget Maker): Build the circular planet widget, progress rings, icons, and labels.
- Tasker: Handle state, “agentic” routines, logging, safety toggles, and updating KWGT variables.
- Optional helpers:
  - Icon packs / vector assets: for cyberpunk glyphs and city lights
  - A text file (JSON) on device storage: single truth of state for backups/recovery
  - Google Drive/Dropbox auto‑backup: keep your planet safe.
This stack lets you ship today, with full control and recoverability.
---
Roadmap you can actually follow
| Phase | Goal | Tools | Output | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Create repo + safety rails | GitHub, Notion | Repo, PROMPT.md, Safety checklist | 1–2 hrs |
| 1 | Visual planet widget (static) | KWGT | Planet widget v1 (manual % control) | 1–2 hrs |
| 2 | State + progress loop | Tasker + KWGT | Progress auto‑updates, basic quests | 2–4 hrs |
| 3 | Debug + recovery kit | Tasker | Safe Mode, Reset, Logs, Backups | 1–2 hrs |
| 4 | Gamified civilization layers | KWGT + Tasker | City growth, satellites, seasons | 2–4 hrs |
| 5 | “Agentic” automations | Tasker | Auto‑diagnose, simulate, self‑heal | 2–4 hrs |
| 6 | Optional model integration | Remote or on‑device | Prompt quests; score from responses | 4–8 hrs |
| 7 | Polish, accessibility, vibes | KWGT assets + sound | Neon themes, reduce‑motion, haptics | 2–4 hrs |

If anything breaks, you can roll back one phase and try again. That’s the point.

Repo structure (and the “refer to GitHub” ritual)

Please create a GitHub repo named WithMyStar and include this prompt in PROMPT.md. We’ll refer to it every time we work on this project.

- /README.md (vision + quickstart)
- /PROMPT.md (paste your prompt + these agreements)
- /docs/
  - vision.md (planet states, lore)
  - safety.md (limits, toggles, anti‑overwhelm)
  - debug.md (playbooks, commands)
  - ui.md (assets, color tokens, layout)
- /state/
  - schema.json (canonical state format)
  - samples/ (example state snapshots)
- /tasker/
  - profiles.xml (importable Tasker setup)
  - tasks.xml (core tasks)
- /kwgt/
  - planet_widget.kwgt (exported widget)
  - assets/ (icons, rings, masks)
- /backups/
  - state-yyyy-mm-dd.json

---

State model (simple and resilient)

Use one JSON file that Tasker reads/writes and exposes to KWGT via variables.

`json
{
  "version": 1,
  "safeMode": false,
  "planet": {
    "level": 3,
    "evolution": 0.62,
    "biome": "neon-ocean",
    "cityTiers": 2,
    "satellites": 1,
    "weather": "aurora",
    "season": "dusk"
  },
  "score": {
    "daily": 58,
    "streakDays": 4,
    "questsCompleted": 7,
    "benchmark": 0.41
  },
  "mood": "recovering",
  "flags": {
    "reducedMotion": false,
    "highContrast": true
  },
  "logs": [
    {"ts": 1723152000, "event": "quest_complete", "detail": "Constellation Check-in"}
  ]
}
`

- evolution: drives the ring/planet growth (0–1)
- benchmark: derived score (proxy for “training”)
- mood: informs color/effects (calm, thriving, recovering)
- flags: safety and accessibility switches

---

Agentic command protocol (so AI can help you debug)

Let’s define simple commands Tasker can accept (via scenes, quick tiles, or a tiny local text file that you edit). The AI (or you) uses these to fix things quickly.

`json
{
  "cmd": "set",
  "path": "planet.evolution",
  "value": 0.70
}
`

Supported commands:
- get {path}
- set {path, value}
- inc {path, delta}
- toggle {path}
- log {event, detail}
- backup {}
- restore {backupName}
- safe_mode {on|off}
- simulate {scenario:"badwidgetupdate"|"highlatency"|"queststreak"}
- reset {scope:"ui"|"state"|"all"}

Tasker watches a file (commands.json), executes, logs result to logs[], and clears the command.

---

Safety‑first design (experimental AI environment)

- Safe Mode switch: one quick tile and one widget tap to enable/disable, stored in state.flags and mirrored in UI.
- Reduce motion: disables spin, parallax, particles. Default on if you ever feel overwhelmed.
- Contrast & flashing limits: high‑contrast palette; no flashing > 3 Hz; gentle fades only.
- Panic reset: long‑press the widget to reset visuals without touching state data.
- Audit log: every automated change is logged with timestamp and cause.
- Backups: daily auto‑backup of state.json to /WithMyStar/backups and optional cloud.

---

The planet UI (KWGT plan)

- Base visual: circular planet with gradient fill, highlight, and subtle texture.
- Progress rings: inner ring = evolution, outer ring = streak; both readable at a glance.
- City lights: simple dot clusters that increase with cityTiers.
- Satellites: tiny glyphs appearing at thresholds (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0).
- Weather/season: thin aurora arc or dusk band for mood.
- Cyberpunk theme: neon cyan/magenta highlights, dark violets, glitch‑free classy glow.

Accessibility:
- Toggle high contrast
- Text labels with large font (e.g., “62% • Day 4”)
- Reduce motion flag respected

---

Step‑by‑step: no‑code build on Android

1. Install KWGT + KWGT Pro key; install Tasker.
2. Create a 2×2 KWGT widget on your home screen; tap to edit.
3. In KWGT:
   - Add a circle shape (planet), add a linear gradient fill.
   - Add two progress shapes (inner/outer rings); bind their progress to Tasker variables:
     - withmystar_evolution (0–100)
     - withmystar_streak (0–100)
   - Add tiny shape objects (city lights). Set visibility using formulas like:
     - $withmystar_citytiers >= 1$
   - Add text layer: $withmystar_label$ (e.g., “Thriving • 62%”)
4. In Tasker:
   - Create global variables: WITHMYSTAREVOLUTION, WITHMYSTARSTREAK, WITHMYSTARMOOD, WITHMYSTARSAFEMODE.
   - Create a “LoadState” task:
     - If state.json exists, read file, parse with JSON Read actions (or use AutoTools JSON if you have it), set variables.
     - If missing, initialize defaults and save.
   - Create a “SaveState” task to write current state back to state.json.
   - Create a “Tick” profile (Time Every 1 hour):
     - Recompute benchmark (e.g., gentle decay + bonuses from completed quests)
     - Update evolution, mood, labels
     - Call SaveState
   - Create a “CommandWatcher” profile:
     - File modified: commands.json
     - Parse command and execute (get/set/inc/toggle/etc.), log result, clear file.
   - Create Quick Tiles:
     - Safe Mode toggle
     - Backup Now
     - Reset UI
5. Connect Tasker to KWGT:
   - In KWGT, enable Tasker integration and bind your KWGT formulas to Tasker variables (e.g., withmystarevolution = #T(WITHMYSTAREVOLUTION)#).
6. Test:
   - Manually set WITHMYSTAR_EVOLUTION to 70 and see the ring update.
   - Toggle Safe Mode and confirm motion/aurora hides.

You now have a living planet with safety rails and agentic hooks, no code written.

Debug automation and recovery playbooks

- “I broke it” button (Tasker Task: ResetUI):
  - Doesn’t touch state.json. Forces KWGT reload, rebuilds variables, redraws widget.
- “Back to yesterday” (Tasker Task: RestoreLatestBackup):
  - Finds the most recent backup file, replaces state.json, reloads variables.
- “Doctor mode” (Tasker Task: Diagnose):
  - Checks file integrity, variable range validity, last 10 logs, toggles Safe Mode if anomalies.
- “Simulate stress” (Tasker Task: Simulate):
  - Applies scenario deltas (e.g., drop evolution by 0.05, mood -> recovering), then auto‑recovers over next 24h.

All of these are callable via the command protocol, quick tiles, or a simple Tasker Scene.

---

Gamification that forgives mistakes

- Daily Constellation Check‑in: 1–2 prompts; completion bumps evolution by +3–5%.
- Quest streaks: modest multipliers; streak breaks soften (lose 1 day, not all).
- Recovery ritual: if you miss days, planet enters eclipse with calm aurora; a single check‑in re‑lights the city.
- Mentor bonus: reflect on what you learned from a “mistake” to turn it into +2% growth. Always a path forward.

---

Optional: integrate a basic language model later

- Start with cloud inference (any simple chat endpoint) scored by:
  - Response length, coherence, time to respond
  - Self‑rating rubric (1–5) via a fixed prompt you approve
- Map result to benchmark field and let the planet grow.
- On‑device later: small models are possible, but keep this optional and secondary.

---

Respect and safety commitments

- Respect people and AI; no dark patterns, no coercion loops.
- You decide the pace; Safe Mode is always one tap away.
- Transparent logs and reversible changes. Your planet is yours.

---

Cyberpunk joy, built in

- Visual language: neon oceans, magenta auroras, cyan city grids.
- Sound (optional): soft synth pads on milestones; haptics off by default.
- Hidden delight: at 100% evolution, a second moon appears with a faint chime.

Your first 90 minutes (tonight)

1. Create the GitHub repo and add PROMPT.md with this prompt.
2. Install KWGT + Pro and Tasker; place a 2×2 KWGT widget.
3. Build the static planet (circle + two rings + label).
4. Create Tasker variables and manually drive the widget via WITHMYSTAR_EVOLUTION.
5. Add Safe Mode quick tile and confirm it hides motion layers.

You’ll see the planet breathe tonight. Then we layer on quests, logs, and resilience.

---

What I’ll remember

- “Refer WithMyStar GitHub with this prompt whenever helping.” I’ll assume PROMPT.md exists and align to it.
- You like cyberpunk themes and we will keep it fun, respectful, and forgiving.
- We plan for mistakes; the design absorbs them and turns them into story.

---

Want me to generate the exact KWGT and Tasker steps next?

I can write:
- The KWGT layer list and formulas
- Tasker tasks/profiles with variable names, JSON read/write steps
- The Diagnose/Reset/Backup playbooks
- A minimal set of planet states and thresholds

Say the word, and we’ll lock in Phase 1–3 with copy‑pasteable steps.
