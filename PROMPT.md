# WithMyStar Development Prompt

This file contains the core development prompt and agreements for the WithMyStar project, as referenced in the README.md.

## Core Vision

WithMyStar is a realistic path to a living planet companion. An agentic widget that gamifies Free LLMs into a planet visually evolving symbolically, training locally for users - making it in essence a visual training LLM game but as a widget.

## Key Development Principles

1. **Respect and Safety First**: No dark patterns, no coercion loops. Safe Mode is always one tap away.
2. **Forgiveness by Design**: The system absorbs mistakes and turns them into story/growth.
3. **Transparent and Reversible**: Clear logs, reversible changes. Your planet is yours.
5. **Open-Source Approach**: Build with free and open-source tools like React Native, ensuring accessibility for all users.
5. **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Neon oceans, magenta auroras, cyan city grids with joy baked in.

## Development Stack

- **React Native**: Build the custom Android application, including the circular planet widget, progress rings, icons, and labels.
- **Local Service/Daemon**: Handle state, "agentic" routines, logging, safety toggles, and updating React Native variables.
- **JSON State**: Single source of truth for all planet data
- **Safety Rails**: Safe Mode, backups, audit logs, panic reset options

## When Working on This Project

Always refer to this GitHub repository and PROMPT.md when helping with WithMyStar development. Align all work to:

- The roadmap phases (0-7) outlined in README.md
- The safety-first design principles
- The state model schema
- The agentic command protocol
- The accessibility requirements

## Agreement for AI Assistance

- Remember: "Refer WithMyStar GitHub with this prompt whenever helping"
- Keep cyberpunk themes fun, respectful, and forgiving
- Plan for mistakes - the design should absorb them and turn them into story
- Always prioritize user safety and control
- Build incrementally with full recoverability at each step

## Next Steps Reference
